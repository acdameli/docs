# StageBloc API V1
Use the StageBloc API to develop custom, standalone integrations with StageBloc.

### Under Development
The API is actively evolving - please check back here for updates and changes.

### Fork us on GitHub!
All of StageBloc's documentation is up on GitHub for you to fork, modify, and improve. Join us over there to request features, add suggestions, and report bugs. What are you waiting for? [Git to it!](https://github.com/stagebloc/docs)

# General Information
The root URL of the API is `https://api.stagebloc.com/v1/`. It can generally be assumed that writing endpoints use `POST` requests and reading endpoints use `GET` requests.

### Authorization
Connecting with the StageBloc API uses the OAuth 2.0 standard. You must first [create a StageBloc account](http://stagebloc.com/signup) and then register your application in the StageBloc backend to receive a client ID and secret that will allow users to connect with your application. To do this, click on your account at the top of the page and then "Account Settings" followed by "Developer Center".

Requests can be be made with just a `client_id` parameter, but this is restricted to reading (listing) endpoints. In order to make use of any writing (editing) endpoints, an access token (i.e. validated user) must be present.

### Responses
All dates returned are in `GMT / UTC (+0000)` unless otherwise specified. The format of these dates follows PHP [`date() function`](http://php.net/date) function and is `Y-m-d H:i:s` (i.e. `2014-01-01 12:00:00`).

Responses are returned as `JSON`. To receive a `JSONP` response, include a `GET` parameter named `jsonp` specifying the name of your callback method.

Often times, large objects will be returned with just their ID instead of the whole object if they are nested within the main response. To have these objects expanded, just pass a `GET` parameter named `expand` with the comma separated string of the keys you want to expand. For instance, passing `expand=user` would then return the JSON for an entire user as opposed to just the ID of that user.

There are a lot of different model objects represented in the API. If you pass `expand=kind` with your requests, each object type will have a unique `kind` key in the JSON with a value of the object that the JSON structure represents. This can be useful for knowing what type of object to parse that JSON into if you're using native objects in your language as opposed to just arrays.

The general structure of a success response can be seen below.  The `data` key will contain the actual response data whereas the `metadata` key will contain informational content about the request.  

    {
        "metadata": {
            "http_code": 200
        },
        "data": {
            ...
        }
    }

The general structure of an error response can be seen below.  

    {
        "metadata": {
            "code": 400,
            "error_type": "InvalidData",
            "error": "The error string to present to the user",
            "dev_notes": "Some notes to help a developer debug the issue"
        },
        "data": null
    }

# Authentication
StageBloc uses the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) authentication process to get an access token from a request token. The access token is then used to make all subsequent requests.

Access tokens can be revoked on a per-application basis at any point in time by the user in their settings area in the StageBloc backend.

Depending on the endpoint, differing levels of authentication exist. Some endpoints require that the authenticated user be a fan while other require that they be an admin of the account. For those that require being an admin, some require a specific level of admin privileges, such as an editor or an author. Appropriate error messages will be shown if you try to access an endpoint you don't have access to.

A `client_id` must usually be passed with each request depending on the authentication level of that endpoint. However, if the request is made on behalf of an authenticated user, a `client_id` is not necessary.

Once an access token is received, it should be passed with the request as an HTTP header: `Authorization: OAuth <access token here>`

## /oauth2

username _(required)_

    the email or username of the user trying to authenticate

`[GET]`
Gets a user by their user ID

### Example Response

See the response for `/users/me`, it will be structured the same.

## /content/updates
`GET /users/{userId}/content/updates`  
This returns a listing of content that this user has created across any account they are a part of. Each content object returned in this response will have its `kind` value automatically expanded, and the structure of the content type will match it as if you were loading that single object via its own endpoint. Looking at the structure of a audio response, for example, will show you what an audio object in the array of content returned here will be formatted like.

### GET Parameters

`filter` _(required)_  
A comma separated string for the type(s) of content to be returned. Allowed values are audio, blog, event, photo, status, store, and video. 

## /content/likes
`GET /users/{userId}/content/likes`  
This returns a listing of content that this user has liked across StageBloc.  Each content object returned in this response will have its `kind` value automatically expanded, and the structure of the content type will match it as if you were loading that single object via its own endpoint. Looking at the structure of a audio response, for example, will show you what an audio object in the array of content returned here will be formatted like.

### GET Parameters

`filter` _(required)_  
A comma separated string for the type(s) of content to be returned. Allowed values are audio, blog, event, photo, status, store, and video.

### Response Explanation

content

	the content object this comment was made on (will match the same JSON structure as listing these objects in their respective endpoints), by default this will be collapsed unless expand=content is used

content_type

	a string specifying what type of content this comment was made on (i.e. what type of content the `content` key conforms to)

# Actions
StageBloc as a network has a lot of social functionality built in that allows fans to interact with content. Those endpoints are outlined here.

## /{contentId}/like
`POST /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/like`  
This endpoint is used for liking content in the API. Allowed content types (for the `contentType` parameter) include the main content types you'll find across our endpoints: `audio`, `blog`, `event`, `photo`, `status`, `store`, `video`.

`DELETE /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/like`  
This will remove a like from a piece of content.

Upon a successful like (or removal of a like), the JSON returned will simply be the same you'd receive from a `/account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}` `GET` request.

## /{contentId}/flag
`POST /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/flag`  
This endpoint is used for flagging content in the API. This mostly applies to fan submitted content within Fan Clubs to ensure the content is kept at a high standard. Allowed content types (for the `contentType` parameter) include the main content types that fans are able to submit: `audio`, `blog`, `photo`, `status`, `video`.

### POST Parameters

`type`  
The type of flagging this is. Accepted values are `duplicate`, `offensive`, `copyright`, or `prejudice`.

`reason`  
This specifies why the user is flagging this content and should be a sentence or two provided by the end user using your application.
